Commercial Guardian AI

Automated Commercial Assurance & Invoice Auditing Agent

This is a local, containerized AI agent designed to prevent commercial leakage by auditing invoices against contract terms.

Key Features

Privacy First: Runs 100% locally using Ollama and Llama 3.2 (3B). No financial data leaves your infrastructure.

RAG Architecture: Ingests PDF/Markdown contracts into a Vector Database to ground decisions in legal reality.

Real-Time Auditing: Checks individual invoices for rate discrepancies, missing approvals, and missed volume discounts.

Forensic Analysis: Aggregates months of data to identify "Price Creep" and systematic billing errors.

Quick Start (Demo)

Prerequisites: Docker Desktop installed.

Start the Demo:

Mac/Linux: ./demo.sh

Windows: .\demo.ps1

Choose Mode:

Mode 1 (Real-Time): Processes invoices.csv. Watch it catch a $20 vs $10 rate error and a missed 10% volume discount.

Mode 2 (Forensic): Generates 6 months of fake data. Watch it detect a price increase from $10.00 to $10.50 starting in Month 3.

Architecture

Model: Llama 3.2 (3B) running on Ollama.

Orchestration: Docker Compose.

Framework: LangChain & Pandas.

Vector DB: ChromaDB (Local).

Customization

New Contracts: Add any .md file to data/contracts/ and restart the demo. The agent will automatically learn the new terms.

New Data: Replace invoices.csv with your own export from SAP/Oracle.
